The carbon market, valued at $100 billion, is experiencing exponential growth, nearly doubling annually. S&P Global forecasts the EU Carbon Price to fluctuate between 80.80 EUR and 95.50 EUR per metric ton of CO2 equivalent (mtCO2e).


## Industry Trends

Businesses now face the necessity of paying regulatory bodies for emitting a tonne of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This market dynamic has also caught the attention of investors, with trading activities surging by 164% last year to reach â‚¬760 billion ($897 billion).
