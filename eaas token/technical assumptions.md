EAAS Token is a **validator**, which will be the main premise in *building a framework* that will allow *cross chain transactions* between blockchains. EAAS validates, meaning there is a *container in every transaction*, so 99% of the value of the funds transfer in the transaction is **another token** e.g., coming from Avalanche, Polygon, Solanaâ€™s, Everscale blockchain ecosystems. 

**The transaction will not happen without the EAAS Token**, which constitutes 1% of the transfer value of the transaction. EAAS is a green Energy *confirmer*. **Without it, it is not possible** to read the transaction. For the world of blockchain technology we give for adoption and scale, which is not easy to achieve being nested only in one ecosystem.

## EAAS as validator of cross chain transactions between blockchains

Before there was *the so-called ERC20 standard* (on which we decided to build EAAS Token) proposed by Vitalic Buterin together with Fabian Vogelsteller, it was Vitalic Buterin who in 2015 *combined blockchain technology* with *a virtual machine* to create **Ethereum**. The **first programmable blockchain** allowed the creation of code executed by a decentralized network of smart contracts.
 
Starting with the ERC20 standard enables the creation of dAap: decentralized applications using this standard from wallets to be *decentralized exchanges*.
 
Thus, it **provides an opportunity** *to build end-to-end solutions in blockchain technology*, which can then **be transferred** to other blockchain networks. Although the current transaction costs on the Ethereum network **prevent** *the distribution of decentralized storage media* in such quantities as we assume due to the transmission costs on the Ethereum network, the problem of scaling Ethereum is solved by other networks such as Polygon or Avalanche created in 2019/2020. The cheapness and speed on this network therefore **allow every component of the EAAS framework** to be built and connected to decentralized native carriers on the network in the form of ERC20.
 
EAAS is also looking *to build out* its **decentralized finances**, essentially its proposed decentralized energy pools. These would allow ERC20-compliant tokens to **provide liquidity**. Using an *AMM (automated market maker)* mechanism, EAAS allows decentralized energy pools to **be bought and sold** without the need for an order from the other side (beyond just providing liquidity). 1inch, UniSwap protocol, among others, are being considered for this.
