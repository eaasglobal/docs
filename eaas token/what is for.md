At the beginning the $DEPIN token complies with the ERC-20 standard and can be stored on *any wallet* that supports this standard, such as **Binance Chain Wallet, MetaMask, TrustWallet, or our platform**.
 

The framework enables $Depin Token some utilities and some use cases like:
 
1. Buying and selling assets on cross chain EAAS Framework,
2. Staking
3. Governance and voting also for government users.
 
**Depin token explorer**
 
$Depin Token explorer is a **porting of BscScan** a public and transparent Binance blockchain explorer to the energy world. It allows us to *present stored decentralized information* about the amount of produced, traded green energy at an individual producer stored on the blockchain. It allows you to **view the transactions** that have taken place *recently* in terms of each decentralized information

It **provides liquidity** in the staking, metaverse and defi framework. In the first interaction of the platform functionality, it is designed according to *ERC20* technology. We assume that the tokenomy of the token used in the EAAS framework **will grow** with increased sales and development of new DePIN hadrwares and Native Application features anf frameword. 
 
The $DEPIN Token made on the blockchain technology ERC20 is a **decentralized information** carrier and will be used in software on the EAAS Global framework, among other things, for *smart contract records*. Each $DEPIN Token unit represents within itself decentralized information that can be **exchanged peer to peer** or through appropriate **smart contract** mechanisms. They are *homogeneous units*. Blockchain technology is such an undeniable carrier of value. Compliance with the ERC20 standard enables an entire ecosystem of contracts created under the utility for homogeneous tokens. The **primary utility** will be the ability to use the software if one has *more than the number of $DEPIN Token set in the tokenomy*.
 
ERC20 technology grew up with **Proof of Stake (PoS)** is a consensus mechanism where block validators are selected **based on the number of coins** they are staking. In this case, the term staking refers to *the act of validators committing funds to the system*. So, validators can only participate in the process of producing new blocks if they **lock their coins**. The PoS scheme was designed as an *alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW)* and, as such, presents a few advantages and disadvantages. On **PoW-based blockchains**, like Bitcoin, the validators (miners) can *only be rewarded* if they **find a valid solution** for a cryptographic puzzle. Such a solution is what makes them eligible to add the next block of transactions in the blockchain. 
 
To ensure that the transactions recorded on the blockchain are correct, networks adopt various consensus mechanisms. **Proof of Work (PoW)** is the oldest of these. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is considered by many to be one of **the most secure** options. **Proof of Stake (PoS)** was created later but is now seen in **most altcoin projects**. Proof of Work is used in Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the network. Among other things, PoW prevents double spending. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the most *commonly used* consensus mechanisms. They are used by major cryptocurrencies **to secure** their networks.
 
The price of a unit is **immutable**. *The token* itself has *no value in itself*, whereas the number of tokens needed for records in the framework changes, resulting in an increase in demand for the token and therefore anyone with a token to resell has the opportunity **to sell** a significant number of tokens previously purchased thus *earning money* on them.

Having a Token enables you to use decentralized software. **$DEPIN Token** is a digital **green validator key**. That allows information to be stored on the blockchain. The decentralized software we are developing will *require* the use of an $DEPIN  Token. Token itself is **a validator** for the on-chain transactions that occur. It is a digital key that enables transactions using tokens from other blockchains. The token can be utilized to exchange CO2 credits, among other purposes, and is also instrumental in facilitating transactions related to **green energy production**.

## What is the Depin Token used for?

Token functions enables in the EAAS framework operations solution. These include **measuring green energy** production or measuring the flow of green energy in a framework.

The token allows for an exchange of value based on the DEX/CEX exchange price.

## The usability of the solution

The usability of the solution today is within the range of possibilities gradually introduced with the development of the project. That is, as the measurement of green production together with the reading of stored values on and off the blockchain, then **the resale of green energy** straight from your own socket, via your own EV charger to:

- neighbor, 
- external partner, 
- at home; and managing the flow of CO2 production (writing the data indisputably on the blockchain).

EAAS *guarantees staking utility*, which means that coin stakers **will earn passive income** from everyday rewards and weekly airdrops coming from the multi-asset staking features.
 
Due to the decentralized model, *stakers will also influence* the crucial aspects of platform development, i.e., yield, buyback, or burn percentage. Moreover, token holders will **enjoy decreasing inflation** model additionally boosted by buyback & burning mechanism, fueled by transaction fees.
