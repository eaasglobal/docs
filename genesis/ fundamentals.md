# Fundamentals

EAAS is a token that is a digital certificate – guarantee of origin – for energy. The validity of this certificate is validated on the blockchain and can be used, stored, or exchanged on a platform created for this purpose. The platform will enable the inclusion of all energy market participants in the unified system, i.e., business, individual, institutional players. The system will be accessible, beneficial, and transparent for all.
 
The most important thing is that EAAS connects, not divides. We focus on cooperation between entities focused on the clean energy market and not on the level of startup capital competition. This approach comes from both - my business experience and the belief that only by joining forces together great goals can be achieved - and this is our ambition.

## How does the search for financing look like?

We completed the private sale with $2.5 million on our account, and we managed to receive support from 10 international funds. We are planning to start our IDO at the turn of the first and second quarters of 2022. We would like to obtain a similar amount of financing during the public offering. According to our plans in the roadmap, this would be enough for the development and further commercialization of the project.
