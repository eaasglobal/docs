EAAS is a token that is a digital certificate – guarantee of origin – for energy. The validity of this certificate is validated on the blockchain and can be used, stored, or exchanged on a platform created for this purpose. The platform will enable the inclusion of all energy market participants in the unified system, i.e., business, individual, institutional players. The system will be accessible, beneficial, and transparent for all.
 
The most important thing is that EAAS connects, not divides. We focus on cooperation between entities focused on the clean energy market and not on the level of startup capital competition. This approach comes from both - my business experience and the belief that only by joining forces together great goals can be achieved - and this is our ambition.
