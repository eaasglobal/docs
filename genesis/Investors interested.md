Chaining Stars | Contango | Crypto League | CSP DAO | Fera Capital
 Fish DAO | Halvings Capital | Lucrosus Capital | Mansa | Synapse Network

They invested in EAAS not only because they believe in the project and our business model. Our long-term cooperation was key as we successfully completed many international projects before.
