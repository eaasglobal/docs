## How does the search for financing look like?

We completed the private sale with $2.5 million on our account, and we managed to receive support from 10 international funds. We are planning to start our IDO at the turn of the first and second quarters of 2022. We would like to obtain a similar amount of financing during the public offering. According to our plans in the roadmap, this would be enough for the development and further commercialization of the project.
