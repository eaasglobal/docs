The PoS scheme was designed as an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) and, as such, presents a few advantages and disadvantages. On PoW-based blockchains, like Bitcoin, the validators (miners) can only be rewarded if they find a valid solution for a cryptographic puzzle. Such a solution is what makes them eligible to add the next block of transactions in the blockchain.","To ensure that the transactions recorded on the blockchain are correct, networks adopt various consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work (PoW) is the oldest of these. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is considered by many to be one of the most secure options. Proof of Stake (PoS) was created later but is now seen in most altcoin projects. Proof of Work is used in Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the network. Among other things, PoW prevents double spending. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the most commonly used consensus mechanisms.

Some of these shifts may be natural, although, human activities have been the main driver of climate change – primarily through burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and oceans above what a natural cycle can cope with. This, in turn, causes shifts and accelerated changes in the local and global climates.

They are extracted and used chiefly for fueling purposes. Over 80% of the CO₂ generated by humans comes from burning fossil fuels.
