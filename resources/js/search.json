We mix IoT, blockchain, and NFT with hardware in the form of an EV charger, the prototype you can see on the film on our YouTube. But we are not going to stop there.

The mission of EAAS is to connect various entities operating within the green energy market to ensure transparency and at the same time create the greatest possible value together. Although there are entities on the market offering the so-called green certificates or intermediaries in energy exchange, none of them perceives the subject as widely as we do.","Our goal is to unite and connect all energy production and consumption participants like governments, administration, energy operators, prosumers and become a leading auditor of the green energy market and a certificate exchange based on blockchain technology."]},{"l":"Changing the status quo in energy origin","p":["We believe in changing the status quo in energy origin. We enable the opening of the market for trading sustainable energy information directly (peer to peer) by all players.","As a first step, we are introducing green energy production certificates guaranteed by records in blockchain technology to allow direct exchange of green energy information on terms available today only to oligopolies.","In the future, we believe that there will be a change in energy regulation that will allow for a legal basis of ownership for produced energy put into power off grid’s models. Eventually, there will also be a revolution in the transmission and consumption of green energy, even without our own power grid.","EAAS Token makes it possible to recognize the origin of energy, validate it in terms of whether it is green energy or not. On this basis, energy can be bought back at a future, probably (historically looking at energy prices) higher price, directly and from any EAAS user."]},{"l":"EAAS Token in our solution","p":["is an investment vehicle,","a cryptocurrency value that certifies green energy production as measured by the EAAS Smart Box and partners technology,","is used to store the value of the energy produced in digital form in the EAAS framework,","is easily transferable and tradable and is used to receive the green energy produced and stored in the EAAS framework."]},{"l":"Support","p":["Do you have a questions?

The validity of this certificate is validated on the blockchain and can be used, stored, or exchanged on a platform created for this purpose. The platform will enable the inclusion of all energy market participants in the unified system, i.e., business, individual, institutional players. The system will be accessible, beneficial, and transparent for all.","The most important thing is that EAAS connects, not divides. We focus on cooperation between entities focused on the clean energy market and not on the level of startup capital competition. This approach comes from both - my business experience and the belief that only by joining forces together great goals can be achieved - and this is our ambition.

EAAS validates, meaning there is a container in every transaction, so 99% of the value of the funds transfer in the transaction is another token e.g., coming from Avalanche, Polygon, Solana’s, Everscale blockchain ecosystems.","The transaction will not happen without the EAAS Token, which constitutes 1% of the transfer value of the transaction. EAAS is a green Energy confirmer. Without it, it is not possible to read the transaction. For the world of blockchain technology we give for adoption and scale, which is not easy to achieve being nested only in one ecosystem."]},{"l":"EAAS as validator of cross chain transactions between blockchains","p":["Before there was the so-called ERC20 standard(on which we decided to build EAAS Token) proposed by Vitalic Buterin together with Fabian Vogelsteller, it was Vitalic Buterin who in 2015 combined blockchain technology with a virtual machine to create Ethereum. The first programmable blockchain allowed the creation of code executed by a decentralized network of smart contracts.","Starting with the ERC20 standard enables the creation of dAap: decentralized applications using this standard from wallets to be decentralized exchanges.","Thus, it provides an opportunity to build end-to-end solutions in blockchain technology, which can then be transferred to other blockchain networks. Although the current transaction costs on the Ethereum network prevent the distribution of decentralized storage media in such quantities as we assume due to the transmission costs on the Ethereum network, the problem of scaling Ethereum is solved by other networks such as Polygon or Avalanche created in 2019/2020. The cheapness and speed on this network therefore allow every component of the EAAS framework to be built and connected to decentralized native carriers on the network in the form of ERC20.","EAAS is also looking to build out its decentralized finances, essentially its proposed decentralized energy pools. These would allow ERC20-compliant tokens to provide liquidity. Using an AMM (automated market maker) mechanism, EAAS allows decentralized energy pools to be bought and sold without the need for an order from the other side (beyond just providing liquidity). 1inch, UniSwap protocol, among others, are being considered for this."]}],[{"l":"Token Public Sale","p":["This public round of EAAS TOKEN has a maximum value of $500,000.

It allows us to present stored decentralized information about the amount of produced, traded green energy at an individual producer stored on the blockchain. It allows you to view the transactions that have taken place recently in terms of each decentralized information and the use of the NFT token in each wallet.","It provides liquidity in the staking, metaverse and defi framework. In the first interaction of the platform functionality, it is designed according to ERC20 technology. We assume that the tokenomy of the token used in the EAAS framework will grow with increased sales and development of new EAAS Smart Box features. The tight coupling of EAAS NFT with hardware in the primary market will cause the EAAS Token price to rise.","The EAAS Token made on the blockchain technology ERC20 is a decentralized information carrier and will be used in software on the EAAS Global framework, among other things, for smart contract records. Each EAAS Token unit represents within itself decentralized information that can be exchanged peer to peer or through appropriate smart contract mechanisms. They are homogeneous units. Blockchain technology is such an undeniable carrier of value. Compliance with the ERC20 standard enables an entire ecosystem of contracts created under the utility for homogeneous tokens. The primary utility will be the ability to use the software if one has more than the number of EAAS Token set in the tokenomy.","ERC20 technology grew up with Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where block validators are selected based on the number of coins they are staking. In this case, the term staking refers to the act of validators committing funds to the system. So, validators can only participate in the process of producing new blocks if they lock their coins. The PoS scheme was designed as an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) and, as such, presents a few advantages and disadvantages. On PoW-based blockchains, like Bitcoin, the validators (miners) can only be rewarded if they find a valid solution for a cryptographic puzzle. Such a solution is what makes them eligible to add the next block of transactions in the blockchain.","To ensure that the transactions recorded on the blockchain are correct, networks adopt various consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work (PoW) is the oldest of these. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is considered by many to be one of the most secure options. Proof of Stake (PoS) was created later but is now seen in most altcoin projects. Proof of Work is used in Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the network. Among other things, PoW prevents double spending. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the most commonly used consensus mechanisms. They are used by major cryptocurrencies to secure their networks.","The price of a unit is immutable. The token itself has no value in itself, whereas the number of tokens needed for records in the framework changes, resulting in an increase in demand for the token and therefore anyone with a token to resell has the opportunity to sell a significant number of tokens previously purchased thus earning money on them.","Having a Token enables you to use decentralized software. EAAS Token is a digital green validator key. That allows information to be stored on the blockchain. The decentralized software we are developing will require the use of an EAAS Token. Token itself is a validator for the on-chain transactions that occur. It is such a digital key that allows transactions to be made using tokens from other blockchains.
