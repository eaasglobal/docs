We mix IoT, blockchain, and NFT with hardware in the form of an EV charger, the prototype you can see on the film on our YouTube. But we are not going to stop there. We are constantly looking for both new technologies and the synergy effect between them.","The green energy market is known for high interest among investors.","Let's start with the fact that we place synergy above the competition. The mission of EAAS is to connect various entities operating within the green energy market to ensure transparency and at the same time create the greatest possible value together. Although there are entities on the market offering the so-called green certificates or intermediaries in energy exchange, none of them perceives the subject as widely as we do.","Our goal is to unite and connect all energy production and consumption participants like governments, administration, energy operators, prosumers and become a leading auditor of the green energy market and a certificate exchange based on blockchain technology."]},{"l":"Changing the status quo in energy origin","p":["We believe in changing the status quo in energy origin. We enable the opening of the market for trading sustainable energy information directly (peer to peer) by all players.","As a first step, we are introducing green energy production certificates guaranteed by records in blockchain technology to allow direct exchange of green energy information on terms available today only to oligopolies.","In the future, we believe that there will be a change in energy regulation that will allow for a legal basis of ownership for produced energy put into power off grid’s models. Eventually, there will also be a revolution in the transmission and consumption of green energy, even without our own power grid.","EAAS Token makes it possible to recognize the origin of energy, validate it in terms of whether it is green energy or not. On this basis, energy can be bought back at a future, probably (historically looking at energy prices) higher price, directly and from any EAAS user."]},{"l":"EAAS Token in our solution","p":["is an investment vehicle,","a cryptocurrency value that certifies green energy production as measured by the EAAS Smart Box and partners technology,","is used to store the value of the energy produced in digital form in the EAAS framework,","is easily transferable and tradable and is used to receive the green energy produced and stored in the EAAS framework."]},{"l":"Support","p":["Do you have a questions?
