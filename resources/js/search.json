The PoS scheme was designed as an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) and, as such, presents a few advantages and disadvantages. On PoW-based blockchains, like Bitcoin, the validators (miners) can only be rewarded if they find a valid solution for a cryptographic puzzle. Such a solution is what makes them eligible to add the next block of transactions in the blockchain.","To ensure that the transactions recorded on the blockchain are correct, networks adopt various consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work (PoW) is the oldest of these. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is considered by many to be one of the most secure options. Proof of Stake (PoS) was created later but is now seen in most altcoin projects. Proof of Work is used in Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the network. Among other things, PoW prevents double spending. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the most commonly used consensus mechanisms. They are used by major cryptocurrencies to secure their networks.","The price of a unit is immutable.

The first programmable blockchain allowed the creation of code executed by a decentralized network of smart contracts.","Starting with the ERC20 standard enables the creation of dAap: decentralized applications using this standard from wallets to be decentralized exchanges.","Thus, it provides an opportunity to build end-to-end solutions in blockchain technology, which can then be transferred to other blockchain networks. Although the current transaction costs on the Ethereum network prevent the distribution of decentralized storage media in such quantities as we assume due to the transmission costs on the Ethereum network, the problem of scaling Ethereum is solved by other networks such as Polygon or Avalanche created in 2019/2020. The cheapness and speed on this network therefore allow every component of the EAAS framework to be built and connected to decentralized native carriers on the network in the form of ERC20.","EAAS is also looking to build out its decentralized finances, essentially its proposed decentralized energy pools. These would allow ERC20-compliant tokens to provide liquidity. Using an AMM (automated market maker) mechanism, EAAS allows decentralized energy pools to be bought and sold without the need for an order from the other side (beyond just providing liquidity). 1inch, UniSwap protocol, among others, are being considered for this."]}],[{"l":"EAAS Tools"},{"l":"CO2 Scoring","p":["CO2 scoring involves assessing the carbon dioxide emissions associated with products, services, or activities.

Some of these shifts may be natural, although, human activities have been the main driver of climate change – primarily through burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, which adds greenhouse gases to the atmosphere and oceans above what a natural cycle can cope with. This, in turn, causes shifts and accelerated changes in the local and global climates. As emissions continue to rise, our planet is now 1.1°C warmer than it was in the late 1800s on average."]},{"l":"Compensation","p":["Compensation is a means to balance the greenhouse gases emitted by a country, an industrial sector, a company, or an individual by investing in projects that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere.
