# EAAS Smart App
Introducing the EAAS Smart App, which will transform environmental sustainability and monetise carbon footprint activities. With three TIERS of validation that take into account varying user demands and technological capabilities, the app ensures the optimum CO2 reduction gains for anyone. 

The Exchange for C02 Credits, which makes carbon offsetting easier, and location-based services that improve user experiences are two of the application's main features. The application encourages cooperation between B2B and B2C companies, which supports a healthy ecosystem. 

Users that engage in sustainable activities will receive CO2 credits, which can be converted into our native currency, $Depin, at a location-based CO2 pricing. The software encourages community donations and ESG compliance procedures to move the group toward sustainable business practices and a more environmentally friendly future. 

By giving users effective environmental assets management toolsᅳwhich are essential for moving towards a sustainable futureᅳthe EAAS App promotes responsible use of natural resources.
