# Air Quality Index (AQI)

# Air pollution
Air pollution is the contamination of the environment by any physical, chemical, or biological agent that changes the natural characteristics of the atmosphere. Air pollution, and its impact on air quality, are closely linked to our climate and ecosystems.

Many drivers of air pollution, such as burning fossil fuels, are also sources of carbon emissions.
