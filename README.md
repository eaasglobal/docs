# Welcome to eaas.global docs

Together, we're not just imagining a greener tomorrow, we're actively building it. eaas.global is committed to leading the industry in sustainability and profitability. With eaas_app, ZKP Algorithm, and DePIN hardware, we harness the potential of carbon footprint data to reward positive environmental actions with $EAAS Tokens

<!--
Where a mission of [eaas.global](https://eaas.global/) is to organize and liberate the green energy market by uniting all players in the market onto our blockchain platform, making the trading of green energy certification totally transparent, traceable, and democratized, while affording the opportunity to better forecast and adapt to the fluctuating demands of the grid through IoT devices, AI and data analytics.

Our vision is to deliver a service, which will **facilitate and automate green energy** trading and provide better usability and transparency for any user. 
 
We aim to unite and connect all the members of the energy production and consumption process: governments, administration, energy, operators, and prosumers and become not only a leading greed energy certifier but also **a green energy certificate exchange.**

## Introduction

 [eaas.global](https://eaas.global/) aims to enhance environmental sustainability by rewarding individuals and corporations for reducing their carbon footprint through verified eco-friendly actions and data. By combining novel legal frameworks with advanced cryptographic and digital measurement technologies—Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP) and Decentralized Physical Interface Network (DePIN) - eaas.global offers a robust platform that not only incentivizes green practices but also facilitates participation in carbon and ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) compliant markets. This integration ensures that contributions are legally sound and align with international protocols such as the Paris Agreement, making sustainability accessible and financially rewarding for everyone

We combine traditional technologies with *solutions of the future.* We mix IoT, blockchain, and with hardware in the form of an EV charger. But we are not going to stop there. We are constantly looking for both **new technologies** and the **synergy effect between them.**

:::information
The green energy market is known for high interest among investors.
:::

Let's start with the fact that we place synergy above the competition. The mission of eaas.global is to **connect various entities operating** within the **green energy market** to ensure transparency and at the same time create the greatest possible value together. Although there are entities on the market offering the so-called green certificates or intermediaries in energy exchange, none of them perceives the subject *as widely as we do.*

Our goal is to **unite and connect** all energy production and consumption participants like governments, administration, energy operators, prosumers and become a leading auditor of the green energy market and a certificate exchange based on blockchain technology.

## Changing the status quo in energy origin

We believe in changing the status quo in energy origin. We enable the opening of the market for trading sustainable energy information directly (peer to peer) by all players.

*As a first step,* we are introducing **green energy production certificates** guaranteed by records in blockchain technology to allow **direct exchange of green energy information** on terms available today only to oligopolies.
 
*In the future,* we believe that there will be **a change in energy regulation** that will allow for a legal basis of ownership for produced energy put into power off grid’s models. Eventually, there will also be a revolution in the transmission and consumption of green energy, even **without our own power grid.**
 
$EAAS Token makes it possible to **recognize** the origin of energy, validate it in terms of whether it is green energy or not. On this basis, energy can be bought back at a future, probably (historically looking at energy prices) higher price, directly and from any eaas user.
