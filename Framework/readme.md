By leveraging our AI-powered EAAS app, and state-of-the-art DePIN hardware, users generate green data within the app interface by completing tasks and taking sustainable actions. Each actions are getting rewarded proportionally based on user TIER's. 

EAAS.GLOBAL packages the collected data into marketable CO2 Credits using a Legal Scoring model and ZKP, creating high-quality CO2 credits and trades them. These trades are then converted into FIAT , and EAAS.GLOBAL buys back $EAAS tokens to provide liquidity and circulation by enabling tokens on both decentralized (DEX) and centralized (CEX) exchanges.

Users can safely claim their accumulated CO2 credits for equivalent available Tokens or FIAT without jeopardizing their privacy by using our innovative ZKP technology. Because these exchanges are customized based on the user's geolocation, fair pricing according to the CO2 credit value in that particular area is guaranteed. 

This comprehensive framework serves as the foundation of EAAS.GLOBAL, driving positive environmental change while also providing financial rewards to users.

With our DePIN Hardware and Native app, users are actively earning CO2 credits within the app interface by completing activities and taking sustainable actions. Each actions are getting rewarded proportionally based on User TIER's.

Within Our Platform, these accrued CO2 credits are then transformed into CO2 Certificates. These credits are converted into FIAT money via EAAS.GLOBAL in order to fund the advancement of projects and the distribution of tokens. 

EAAS.GLOBAL provides liquidity and circulation by enabling the repurchase of tokens on both centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX) exchanges. Users can safely trade their accumulated CO2 credits for comparable $EAAS Tokens without jeopardizing their privacy by using our innovative Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) technology. Because these exchanges are customized based on the user's geolocation, fair pricing according to the CO2 credit value in that particular area is guaranteed.
