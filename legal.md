# Legal Framework

### International Law:

-  **Paris Agreement**, with the special importance of the article 6 (1) :       
    - allows Parties to use international trading of emission allowances to help achieve emissions reduction targets    
    - establishes a framework for common robust accounting rules, and creates a new, more ambitious market mechanism.  

- **Kyoto Protocol**
- **Framework Convention on Climate Change UN**
    - guide for conducting measurements for estimation of carbon stocks in afforestation and reforestation (A/R) project activities under the clean development mechanism


## EU Law:

Main framework established by a set of proposal called Fit for 55 package is the basis, formally adopted in april 2023:
-  revision to the EU emission trading system **(EU ETS)**(2) and a creation of **EU ETS 2** - separate from EU ETS, in order to cover: “ … CO2 emissions from fuel combustion in buildings, road transport and additional sectors (mainly small industries not covered by the existing EU ETS).”(3)
-  **Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)** to function in symbiosis with the EU ETS, preventing the offsetting in EU at the cost of countries outside its borders(4)
- **The land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF)** regulation amended in order to increase the GHG reduction targets(5)
- **The effort sharing regulation**, binding annual greenhouse gas emissions targets for member states not covered be neither EU ETS, nor LULUCF
- The establishment of **Social Climate Fund**(6), created 

Additionally:

- **EU Auctioning Regulation**(7), establishing rules for participation, trading and participation in EU ETS
- **The EU- China joint statement** on the Climate Change(8), 
- **Korean Emission Trading Scheme (K-ETS)** (9)
- [CARBON DIOXIDE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1346980/000119312511080561/dex1031.htm)



- International Carbon Action Partnership(10)

ICAP ETS Map provides and visualizes up-to-date information on ETSs around the world – including systems that are in force, under development and under consideration. The interactive map features downloadable factsheets and gives granular information on individual design aspects(11)

and  of  the  Council by establishing a minimum threshold for greenhouse gas 
emissions savings of recycled carbon fuels and by specifying a methodology for 
assessing greenhouse gas emissions savings from renewable liquid and gaseous
transport fuels of non-biological origin and from recycled carbon fuels(15)

### ISO

### Exploring legal pathways

Documents listed below are undergoing a thorough investigation in order to determine their suitability as one of the pillars of our Sustainability metrics:

- **The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors**, newly adopted by the US’ Security and Exchange Commission
- Forests Stewardship Council (FSC) certification (18)
