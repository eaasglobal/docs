# ESG/Carbon in Compliance with Law


### ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance):

ESG stands for Environmental, Social, and Governance, representing a set of criteria used by investors and stakeholders to evaluate a company's sustainability and ethical impact.

Environmental factors consider a company's impact on the environment, such as its carbon footprint, energy efficiency, and waste management practices.

Social factors assess how a company interacts with its employees, communities, and broader society, including diversity, labor practices, and community engagement.

Governance factors examine a company's leadership, transparency, accountability, and adherence to ethical standards and regulatory requirements.
Carbon:

### Carbon

 Carbon refers to the element carbon and its compounds, including carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a greenhouse gas emitted through human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.

In the context of environmental sustainability, carbon management involves measuring, reducing, offsetting, and mitigating carbon emissions to combat climate change and minimize environmental impact.

Carbon compliance refers to the adherence to legal and regulatory requirements related to carbon emissions, pollution control, and environmental protection laws at local, national, and international levels.

### Green Energy

Green energy, also known as renewable energy, comes from naturally replenishable sources such as sunlight, wind, water, and biomass.
Unlike fossil fuels, green energy sources are sustainable, clean, and emit minimal greenhouse gases during energy production.

Examples of green energy include solar power, wind power, hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, and bioenergy.

Green energy initiatives aim to reduce dependence on fossil fuels, mitigate climate change, promote energy security, and foster sustainable development.

These topics are essential components of corporate sustainability, environmental stewardship, and efforts to address climate change through responsible business practices and regulatory compliance.
