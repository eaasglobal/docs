# What it is for?

It provides liquidity in the staking, metaverse and defi framework. In the first interaction of the platform functionality, it is designed according to ERC20 technology. We assume that the tokenomy of the token used in the EAAS framework will grow with increased sales and development of new EAAS Smart Box features. The tight coupling of EAAS NFT with hardware in the primary market will cause the EAAS Token price to rise.
 
The EAAS Token made on the blockchain technology ERC20 is a decentralized information carrier and will be used in software on the EAAS Global framework, among other things, for smart contract records. Each EAAS Token unit represents within itself decentralized information that can be exchanged peer to peer or through appropriate smart contract mechanisms. They are homogeneous units. Blockchain technology is such an undeniable carrier of value. Compliance with the ERC20 standard enables an entire ecosystem of contracts created under the utility for homogeneous tokens. The primary utility will be the ability to use the software if one has more than the number of EAAS Token set in the tokenomy.
 
ERC20 technology grew up with Proof of Stake (PoS) is a consensus mechanism where block validators are selected based on the number of coins they are staking. In this case, the term staking refers to the act of validators committing funds to the system. So, validators can only participate in the process of producing new blocks if they lock their coins. The PoS scheme was designed as an alternative to the Proof of Work (PoW) and, as such, presents a few advantages and disadvantages. On PoW-based blockchains, like Bitcoin, the validators (miners) can only be rewarded if they find a valid solution for a cryptographic puzzle. Such a solution is what makes them eligible to add the next block of transactions in the blockchain. 
 
To ensure that the transactions recorded on the blockchain are correct, networks adopt various consensus mechanisms. Proof of Work (PoW) is the oldest of these. Created by Satoshi Nakamoto, it is considered by many to be one of the most secure options. Proof of Stake (PoS) was created later but is now seen in most altcoin projects. Proof of Work is used in Bitcoin to validate transactions and secure the network. Among other things, PoW prevents double spending. Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) are the most commonly used consensus mechanisms. They are used by major cryptocurrencies to secure their networks.
 
The price of a unit is immutable. The token itself has no value in itself, whereas the number of tokens needed for records in the framework changes, resulting in an increase in demand for the token and therefore anyone with a token to resell has the opportunity to sell a significant number of tokens previously purchased thus earning money on them.
 
Having a Token enables you to use decentralized software. EAAS Token is a digital green validator key. That allows information to be stored on the blockchain. The decentralized software we are developing will require the use of an EAAS Token. Token itself is a validator for the on-chain transactions that occur. It is such a digital key that allows transactions to be made using tokens from other blockchains. The token itself can be used to, among other things, remove the nft token associated with EAAS Smart Box and used for green energy production.

## What is the EAAS Token used for?

Token functions enables in the EAAS Token framework operations solution. These include measuring green energy production or measuring the flow of green energy in a framework.

The token allows for an exchange of value based on the DEX/CEX exchange price.

## The usability of the solution

The usability of the solution today is within the range of possibilities gradually introduced with the development of the project. That is, as the measurement of green production together with the reading of stored values on and off the blockchain, then the resale of green energy straight from your own socket, via your own EV charger to:

- neighbor, 
- external partner, 
- at home; and managing the flow of CO2 production (writing the data indisputably on the blockchain).

EAAS guarantees staking utility, which means that coin stakers will earn passive income from everyday rewards and weekly airdrops coming from the multi-asset staking features.
 
Due to the decentralized model, stakers will also influence the crucial aspects of platform development, i.e., yield, buyback, or burn percentage. Moreover, token holders will enjoy decreasing inflation model additionally boosted by buyback & burning mechanism, fueled by transaction fees.

## EAAS Token benefits for investors

EAAS Token also give some benefits for investors in the EAAS’s framework, among them:
 
1. Staking Utility – where EAAS stakers will earn passive income not only from everyday EAAS rewards but also from weekly airdrops coming from our multi-asset staking feature.

2. Governance – when EAAS stakers will have an influence on the crucial aspects of platform development such as staking yield, buyback & burn percentage etc.
 
3. Deflationary Tokenomics – then EAAS token holders will enjoy decreasing inflation model additionally boosted by buyback & burning mechanism, fueled by transaction fees.

## How to earn EAAS Token?

The EAAS Token can be obtained by profiting from the secondary market for renewable
energy trading, also by profiting from trading the decentralized EAAS Token for the
prosumer in energy payments on DEX/CEX exchanges
